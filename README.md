Code for Node classification and Link Prediction has been separated out into two files for ease of understanding; both use the same HD node representations as mentioned in the paper.

Packages and libraries from March 13, 2024, on Google Colab (as referenced in the Release Notes at https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/relnotes.ipynb#scrollTo=87e07d5b) and DGL version v2.2.1 were used for obtaining the results presented in the paper.

Please visit the DGL website (https://www.dgl.ai) to find a stable version that is compatible with your version of PyTorch and CUDA. Google Colab regularly updates it's PyTorch and CUDA versions.
