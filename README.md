# Hyperdimensional Representation Learning for Node Classification and Link Prediction

This repo contains an implementation of the HDGL (Hyperdimensional Graph Learner) as described in the WSDM 2025 paper "Hyperdimensional Representation Learning for Node Classification and Link Prediction".

Code for Node classification and Link Prediction has been separated out into two files for ease of understanding.

Packages and libraries from March 13, 2024, on Google Colab (as referenced in the Release Notes at https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/relnotes.ipynb#scrollTo=87e07d5b) and DGL version v2.2.1 were used for obtaining the results presented in the paper.

Please visit the DGL website (https://www.dgl.ai) to find a stable version that is compatible with your version of PyTorch and CUDA. Google Colab regularly updates it's PyTorch and CUDA versions.
